Real-time Face Recognition - README
📌 Introduction
The Real-time Face Recognition System is a Python-based application that detects and recognizes faces using OpenCV and Local Binary Patterns Histogram (LBPH). The system allows capturing and storing facial data, training a recognition model, and identifying individuals in real-time. This project is ideal for security, attendance tracking, and identity verification.

✨ Features
-✅ Real-time Face Detection using Haar cascades. -✅ Face Recognition with LBPH for fast and efficient identification. -✅ Multi-Angle Training to improve recognition accuracy. -✅ Automatic Model Updating when new faces are added. -✅ Threaded Execution for optimized performance. -✅ Graphical Interface (Planned Enhancement).

📋 System Requirements
Hardware
A computer with a webcam (built-in or external)
Minimum 4GB RAM for smooth execution
Recommended: Intel i5 or higher
Software
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy (numpy)
Pickle (pickle)
Threading (concurrent.futures)
